# Convolution-for-Image-Filtering-and-Feature-Extraction-

Implemneted a 2D convolution without using the built-in cv.filter2D() function, tested and implmented my results, discussed diffferences between my implemnetation and compared it with the OpenCV implementation. This is explained in Task 1 in the report.
In Task 2, I compared the differences between SIFT vs SURF vs ORB. I then used OpenCV functions to extract ORB keypoints and visualised the detected keypoints from two images, I also extracted the descriptors using SIFT and ORB, performed keypoint matching using Brute-Force Matcher, from the results I belive SIFT was the best method, this is explained in the report.
